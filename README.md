# Current
## A project for UB Hacking 

### Main issue as of 00:31, EST:
In *Current/Posters.swift* under ListItemView:
The animation takes anywhere between 0.5 to 4 seconds to begin. I am not sure how to debug this at this time because I'm not sure what other task could be holding this up, otherwise I'd try moving that task to the background.

Also yes I know my organization is a mess right now, I'm on a time limit though :)
